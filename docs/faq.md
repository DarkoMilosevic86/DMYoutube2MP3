# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## ❓ No notification when download finishes?

- On some systems `wx.adv.NotificationMessage` may not work reliably.
- Make sure you have Windows 10+ and notifications enabled.

## ❓ SmartScreen warning?

- The installer is unsigned – Windows shows warnings by default.
- Click "More info" → "Run anyway"

## ❓ Where is the config saved?

- `%APPDATA%\DMYoutube2MP3\config.json`
- Existing config is not overwritten by the installer.
